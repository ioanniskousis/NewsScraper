NewsScraper is an application that gathers content from news websites and shows the results organized in sections of interest.  
By targeting particular mark-up elements, searches for titles and descriptions of news. For each website to search it‚Äôs content a configuration file is required which is added to the source modules list. The configuration file uses detailed format described in the configuration section of this document.
At this current version, two news paper sites are configured, the Newsweek and The New York Times websites.  
In order to expand scraping, one can create a new configuration module and add it to the source_modules list.
